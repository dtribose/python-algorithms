Build a tree structure
Have it double in size on every level
have the value of every node equal to the hash of the sum of hashes of the two children nodes
If a leaf node is initialized with no value make it zero.
If a leaf node is initialized with a value, it's stored value will be the hash of that value.
This is a sparse tree and we want to intialize it to 64 levels.
Only store nodes that are not initialized with zero.
Create an update script so that updating a leaf node updates all the parents.
